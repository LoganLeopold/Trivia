# Logan's Trivia Build

## Technologies Used

For this project I simply employed HTML - CSS - Javascript relationships. I gave my index.html doc sources of both a main.css and main.js file so that vanilla Javascript gave the site dynamism that and it was styled with CSS.

## Build Approach

Upon the advice of some wise friends, I did begin this build with pseudo-code. While this didn't save an enormous amount of trouble, I do think it set me on a good path. This was a fairly simple build though, so I did see the value of the base pseduo-code would set for a project not even very much larger than this. 

After I pseudo-coded I did use a mix of pseudo-code and unified modeling language as baselines for establishing functions I knew I'd need to carry out and for defining elements in my html they would be carried out on. 

Concerning those elements, in my approach I was lazy with drying my code early. My querySelectors stayed long and drew out the visual distraction for me when looking through my own code. Had I taken more care to avoid unnecessary length, I may have more easily seen some more redunancies in my code body that only exponentiated the extent to which I felt the code was busy/long. Following wise advice though, my first goal was to get it *working*. 

This was a huge victory, for after basic HTML + CSS to be able to discern what Javascript was doing was written it did not take me long until I had a working application. After it "worked" I simply needed to add features, which I did piece-meal. 

As I sorted out scripting some of the features, I learned a great deal about considering scope, timing, and how elements are manipulated in the dom and rendered. 

## Installation

For this project, since it is vanilla versions of all of these languages
